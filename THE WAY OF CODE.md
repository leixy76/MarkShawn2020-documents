subtitle: The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding
---
> Based on Lao Tzu  Adapted by Rick Rubin

>Each encounter I’ve had with Lao Tzu has pointed  
to something new. Almost as if the book changes  
with every reading. I first picked up Stephen Mitchell’s  
translation 40 years ago at the Bodhi Tree bookstore  
in Los Angeles and my life has never been quite the same.  
— Rick Rubin

### 01

The code that can be named is not the eternal code. The function that can be defined is not the limitless function.

The nameless is the origin of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of ten thousand things.

Free from desire, you see essence unformed. Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

These two spring from the same source but differ in name only. This model is the mystery. The gateway to all understanding.

### 02

When we recognize code as elegant, other code becomes sloppy. When we praise efficiency, the notion of waste is born.

Being and non-being create each other. Simple and complex define each other. Long and short determine each other. High and low distinguish each other. Front-end and back-end follow each other.

Therefore The Vibe Coder builds without laboring and instructs by quiet example. Things arise and he accepts them. Things vanish and he lets them go.

He holds without claiming possession. Creates without seeking praise. Accomplishes without expectation. The work is done and then forgotten. That is why it lasts forever.

### 03

If you praise the programmer, others become resentful. If you cling to possessions, others are tempted to steal. If you awaken envy, others suffer turmoil of heart.

The Vibe Coder leads: By emptying the mind of expectation and filling up the soul. By releasing ambition and embracing the unknown.

Free from intellect, free from abstraction, The Vibe Coder leads all things back to natural self-sufficiency.

Do by not doing, and there is nothing that cannot be done.

### 04

Empty, yet inexhaustible, fathomless and eternal. Source is the ancestor of elegant patterns.

It smooths sharp logic, unravels the knots of control. It softens the glare of complexity, and merges with every challenge. Code flows, effortless, from its depths.

It is unseen yet always present. I do not know its origin. Heaven and earth came later. It is older than God.

### 05

Heaven and earth are impartial, they see the ten thousand things as they are. The Vibe Coder is impartial, he sees the program as it is.

The space between input and mind is like a bellows: empty, yet infinitely capable. The more you allow it, the more it produces. The more you speak of it, the less you understand.

Stillness runs the machine. Hold fast to the silent center.

### 06

The spirit of the valley never dies. She is the primordial feminine. Her womb, the root of heaven and earth.

Her fertility, always present. Use it, it will never fail.
